*Note- This project was a part of Icertis AI/ML and blockchain hackathon and was selected in the finals(12 teams across India).* 

## Problem Statement
Farmers in developing countries like India have always been at the mercy of the weather. Changing weather patterns have further aggravated the problem.
Traditional forms of crop insurance are slow, capital-intensive and often economically unviable for private businesses. Farmers are also unwilling to get their crops insured because of a lack of trust in the insurance companies and the fear of delayed/non-payment of claims.

## Idea
An easy to use, secure interface to manage insurance policies, farm details and other information through a website and/or mobile app using blockchain technology to design a solution that will allow fast settlement of crop insurance claims along with the weather data to determine drought or excessive rainfall at farm locations to automatically trigger settlements.
